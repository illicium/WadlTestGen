# Various filesystem paths that are needed to generate a test suite
    paths:
        # The path to the WADL file that describes the API
        wadlFile: wadl/testWADL.xml
        # The directory where the generated test suite is output
        outputDirectory: gen/test/
        # The directory containing templates that will be processed by the generator
        # and static files that will be copied as-is
        templateDirectory: tpl/

# API configuration that is mainly used in the templates
    api:
        # The type of API this WADL is describing. Currently the two options
        # are "PLAIN" and "SOURCE". The former uses a regular XHR call (with an optional
        # proxy) to call the API, and the latter uses the Apigee Source library.
        type: PLAIN

        ### PLAIN only

        # Proxy settings to get around same origin policy restrictions in the test suite
        proxy:
            # Whether or not the proxy is used to make API calls
            enabled: true
            # Proxy base address; usually local. This is used as a simple prefix for the API
            # calls, like so: http://localhost:8080/http://example.com
            base: http://localhost:8080/

        ### SOURCE only

        source:
            # The application name, used to construct an endpoint of the form:
            #      https://{appName}-api.apigee.com/v1
            appName: sourceapp
            # A username associated with the Source application, used to authenticate and retrieve a Smartkey
            username: user
            # A password for the given user
            password: pass

# You can specify your own arbitrary template parameters here. This section is optional.
    tpl:
        hello: world
